# Learning MERN Stack ðŸš€

Hi, I'm **Shaurya Gupta**, and I'm currently learning the **MERN Stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) to become a Full Stack Developer.

This repository contains all the projects, exercises, and notes from the course [CodeWithHarry Web-dev Course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu0W_9lII9agq5TrH9XLIKQvv0iaF2X3w).  
The files span from **January to July**, and although I didn't commit daily earlier, Iâ€™m now making a consistent effort to **push updates regularly**.

Stay tuned for daily progress and improvements! ðŸŒ±
